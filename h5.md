### Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography 

#### Chapter 1: Foundations, Section 1.1 Terminology

* Plainly readable text or data / Plaintext -> can be scrambled via methods of encryption -> results in a ciphertext -> can be decrypted to form the original plaintext. Provides confidentiality between a sender and a receiver.
* Authentication = the origin of a message / data must verifiable and non-falsifiable (sender can be verified).
* Integrity = the content of a message / data must verifiable and non-falsifiable (message verified to not be modified in transit).
* Nonrepudiation = the act of sending a message / data must verifiable and non-falsifiable (sender cant falsely deny sending a message for example).
* Modern cryptographic algorithms rely on keys for encryption and decryption.
* Symmetric algorithms = encryption and decryption key are usually the same, so called single-key algorithms.
* Asymmetric algorithms / Public-Key Algorithms = encryption key is different from decryption key. Encryption key often referred to as public key and decryption key as private key.

#### Chapter 2 - Protocol Building Blocks, Section 2.5 Communications Using Public-Key Cryptography

* Public-key cryptography described by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman in 1976.
* The basic steps for communication using Public-key cryptography:
  1. Agreement to use public-key cryptosystem
  2. Receiver sends Sender their public key
  3. Sender encrypts data using receivers public keyand sends it receiver
  4. Receiver decrypts data sent by sender using their private key
* In real-world scenarios, public-key cryptography is most often used for securely sending symmetric algorithm keys, as they offer vastly better performance. This can be referred to as a hybrid cryptosystem
* Merkle's puzzles explored the problem of secure communication over insecure channels, by creating problems/challenges that were faster and easier to solve for the sender and receiver than for a third party.
* Digital signatures use same principles and algorithms for signing documents, though they also require a third party to either facilitate the signing or as an authority for verification purposes.
