### Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography 

#### Chapter 1: Foundations, Section 1.1 Terminology

* Plaintext -> can be scrambled via methods of encryption -> results in a ciphertext -> can be decrypted to form the original plaintext. Provides for example confidentiality between a sender and a receiver
* Authentication = the origin of a message / data must verifiable and non-falsifiable (sender can be verified)
* Integrity = the content of a message / data must verifiable and non-falsifiable (message verified to not be modified in transit)
* Nonrepudiation = the act of sending a message / data must verifiable and non-falsifiable (sender cant falsely deny sending a message for example)
* Modern cryptographic algorithms rely on keys for encryption and decryption
* Symmetric algorithms = encryption and decryption key are usually the same, so called single-key algorithms
* Asymmetric algorithms / Public-Key Algorithms = encryption key is different from decryption key. Encryption key often referred to as public key and decryption key as private key.

#### Chapter 2 - Protocol Building Blocks, Section 2.5 Communications Using Public-Key Cryptography
