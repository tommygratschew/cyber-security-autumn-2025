1. Summary and checklist of the assessment process (page 10)
   
   - The checklist of the assessment process can be summarized in 5 steps:
     
     1. Initiate assessment (decision to start & object of assessment. Appoint sponsor and facilitator)
     2. Prepare for assessment (define areas to be assessed & critical dependencies. Identify required personnel for assessment, assessment method and schedule)
     3. Conduct assessment (using the Cybermeter)
     4. Identify development activities (analyze results, define target level, identify & prioritize development activities)
     5. Perform activities and update assessment (launch a re-assessment if necessary)
   
2. Cybermeter maturity model (pages 11-14)

   - Maturity model scores development activities at four levels, from level 0 (the worst) to level 3 (the best).
   - The model proposes a few key concepts regarding to organizational capabilities (regarding cybersecurity), the definition of a maturity model and operating area (relevant areas of organization to be assessed)
   - the model is divided into 11 domains of assessment, these include factors such as protection of critical services, risk management or threat and vulnerability management to list a few
   - Within these domains 52 objectives and related practices are defined in order to measure organizational maturity using the maturity indicator level calculation model
   - To calculate an organizations cybersecurity maturity level from 0 to 3, each practice assessed based on levels of implementation (not implemented, partly implemented, mostly implemented & fully implemented)
   - Each domain is is assessed based on these answers and a level is given for every specific domain, the level is always capped at lowest reached maturity level within the specified domain (for example failing to meet any level 1 objectives,       means the level for that specific domain can't go beyond level 1, even if all other level 2 & 3 objectives were met)
