### Traficom: Cybermeter - User guide

1. Summary and checklist of the assessment process (page 10)
   
   - The checklist of the assessment process can be summarized in 5 steps:
     
     1. Initiate assessment (decision to start & object of assessment. Appoint sponsor and facilitator)
     2. Prepare for assessment (define areas to be assessed & critical dependencies. Identify required personnel for assessment, assessment method and schedule)
     3. Conduct assessment (using the Cybermeter)
     4. Identify development activities (analyze results, define target level, identify & prioritize development activities)
     5. Perform activities and update assessment (launch a re-assessment if necessary)
   
2. Cybermeter maturity model (pages 11-14)

   - Maturity model scores development activities at four levels, from level 0 (the worst) to level 3 (the best).
   - The model proposes a few key concepts regarding to organizational capabilities (regarding cybersecurity), the definition of a maturity model and operating area (relevant areas of organization to be assessed)
   - the model is divided into 11 domains of assessment, these include factors such as protection of critical services, risk management or threat and vulnerability management to list a few
   - Within these domains 52 objectives and related practices are defined in order to measure organizational maturity using the maturity indicator level calculation model
   - To calculate an organizations cybersecurity maturity level from 0 to 3, each practice assessed based on levels of implementation (not implemented, partly implemented, mostly implemented & fully implemented)
   - Each domain is is assessed based on these answers and a level is given for every specific domain, the level is always capped at lowest reached maturity level within the specified domain (for example failing to meet any level 1 objectives,       means the level for that specific domain can't go beyond level 1, even if all other level 2 & 3 objectives were met)

3. The Cybermeter maturity report (page 23)

   - A more detailed report of the organizations cybersecurity maturity level aimed at designated professionals of the organization
   - In addition to displaying the maturity indicator level for each objective within a domain, the report visualizes the current, previous and reference levels for domains with a graph

### Traficom: Cybermeter - Spreadsheet

   - The cybermeter tool itself is an excel spreadsheet (great, since can be used offline and doesn't store your data / answers anywhere else)
   - Supported languages include finnish, english and swedish
   - Based on the Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model (C2M2) by U.S. Department of Energy and Cybersecurity Framework by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)

## a) Make-belief analysis

This short story is between Jack, Jill & Joe. They work for company Y, which is currently working on applying the Cybermeter self-assessment tool into their organization. Jack is a cybersecurity professional working for the company acting as the facilitator in this scenario. Jill is a Process owner responsible for a plethora of systems in the company and Joe on the other hand is the Technical owner of these systems. They are currently working through the Access-domain.

2d. Logical access requirements incorporate the principle of least privilege

2f. Logical access requests are reviewed and approved by the asset owner

***

**Jack:** So, let's move on to practice 2d. I know that we have some sort of least privilege principles in place, but can you specify this for Foobar and the other systems you are responsible for, as you know more details about this?

**Jill:** Yes, all access for the systems we are reviewing require for the user to request access with a specific profile defined for specific duties of the applicant

**Joe:** What Jill said, we have logically separated these access rights to a few categories such as viewer, user, super user and administrator.

**Jill:** The access rights are also set up in a way that they expire after a year and need a new access request to extend the expiration date to keep using the system

**Jack:** Sounds good, what sort of application does the applicant need to fill in order to request access?

**Jill:** Good question. They need to specify things like specific work related assignments that require access to the system, expiration date for the access rights with the maximum being for a year at a time etc.

**Jack:** Alright, that sounds fair. I think we can mark this as fully implemented in that case, would you agree?

**Jill:** Yes, sounds good!

**Joe:** Yep!

...

**Jack:** Alright, what about practice 2f. then? How have we set up the access request review and approval process.

**Joe:** In theory, both the technical and process owner approval are needed for the access request approval, but we currently have a few systems that only require one approval for some reason. We are currently looking for a fix to this, so that the process would work as intended.

**Jill:** Yeah, that's a problem currently. Thankfully the review-system partly works so that some sort of review is conducted but the situation isn't ideal right now

**Jack:** Alright well it sounds to me that the current situation calls for a partially implemented categorization and i'll add a comment there that the fix is currently being worked on. Does that sound fair and do you have an estimate for the fix?

**Joe:** That's fair, I think the problem will be fixed within a month. There are a couple of more critical issues with some other systems I need to fix first before I can truly start looking at this problem.

**Jill:** Yeah, that sounds fine!

## b) Sucks or succeeds

The Cybermeter process could be useless if the personnel and company don't commit to actual changes based on the maturity assessment generated by the tool. In that case using the tool would be a complete waste of time. Other reasons could include things like lack of skills and qualifications of the personnel using and facilitating the use of the tool, which could impact the actual results if questions were mistankenly answered poorly or something regarding them missed completely. Some personnel using the tool might also lie about the true state of things being reviewed, which would falsify the results and have them be useless in that sense.

Based on the earlier tasks of the assignment, it is safe to say that the Cybermeter provides an excellent framework (or checklist) of things to be verified. You could also assume that the domains, objectives and practices listed are professionally curated and chosen for a reason in order to cover only relevant aspects of cybersecurity. Following and committing to the framework would definitely leave the organization in a better place even if no changes would need to be done as even in that case you could get some peace of mind knowing that at least the most pressing issues are handled well in your organization.

## c) Competition

One competing framework that comes to mind first is C2M2, the framework that cybermeter is based on. The glaring issue with using this tool is the implementation method of the tool which is mainly an online HTML-based form. This raises a question of who has access to the data added to the online tool (probably shouldn't list all your most vulnerable systems etc. there as Tero mentioned in class). Though to be fair, an offlin PDF-version is also available through a request.
