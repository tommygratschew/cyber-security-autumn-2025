# h3 - Cyber lab

Computer hardware used to complete the assignment:

* CPU: Intel i5-8250U
* GPU: Intel UHD Graphics 620 (Integrated Graphics on CPU)
* RAM: 8 GB

***

## x) Read/watch/listen and summarize:

**Karvinen 2020: Command Line Basics Revisited**

* Great rundown of the most essential commands and how to navigate the command line
* Funnily enough I used Tero's original "Command Line Basics" -article when I was first learning Linux and the administrative commands are a great add for this topic
* Definitely a good idea to push people to use nano instead of vim for example, especially if they are new to Linux and the command line ;-D

**Karvinen 2022: Cracking Passwords with Hashcat** 

* Excellently packaged and informative guide on how to crack a basic password with hashcat
* Heard of the Rockyou-dictionary before (probably in a Darknet Diaries episode) and now finally getting to use it in context is extremely interesting!
* Command flag and output breakdowns are very nice when learning and trying to understand something new such as this!
    
## a) Reserve your presentation title in Moodle

Presentation title reserved in moodle, related to network security!

## b) Linux. Install Linux on a virtual machine. Use Debian 13-Trixie.

I had previously installed VirtualBox on my desktop computer in the voluntary assignment of h1. For this task I decided to do it again on my laptop, as this is the computer I use for the lectures and is therefore more meaningful to have the VM and Linux installed on this computer instead. I started by downloading Oracle VirtualBox (7.2.4) & Extension pack from the VirtualBox download page. While trying to install VirtuaBox on my computer I ran into some issues. Firstly, it seemed I was missing Microsoft Visual C++ redistributable 2019 from the computer which made the VirtualBox installer fail. After downloading and installing the X64 version of the Latest supported (2015–2022) package and rebooting my computer the installer worked. While doing this reboot I also made sure I had virtualization enabled in my laptops BIOS.

To create the VM itself I started by clicking the "New" -button on VirtualBox Manager. I specified the following attributes for the VM (other settings left at default values):

* VM Name = Debian
* ISO Image = debian-live-13.1.0-amd64-xfce.iso (ISO downloaded in h2 section d.)
* Proceed with Unattended Installation = Unchecked
* OS Version = Debian 13 Trixie (64-bit)
* Base Memory = 2048 MB
* Number of CPUs = 2
* Disk Size = 40 GB

After this I clicked "Finish" and launched the VM. On the boot menu I chose the default option "Live system (amd64)". After a bit of waiting I was brought to the desktop. From here, I clicked the Shortcut "Install Debian". For the options, I chose the following:

* Language = American English
* Location = Helsinki
* Keyboard = Finnish (Default)
* Partitions = Erase disk
* User = I defined my name, username and password. Chose a random, non-identifiable name for the computer

After defining these attributes, I proceeded to install Debian on the VM. After a while the installation procedure completed and I was brought to the login screen, where I logged in with the credentials defined during the installation process.

## c) Crack. Crack the hash 6b1628b016dff46e6fa35684be6acc96 .

Following Tero's guide for password cracking with Hashcat, I started by updating my package lists with: 

``sudo apt-get update``

After which I installed the necessary packages, hashcat, hashid & wget with the following command:

``sudo apt-get -y install hashid hashcat wget``

I then created a folder where to download the dictionary file

``mkdir h3``

and navigated inside with

``cd h3``

I then proceeded to download the dictionary that we will use, in this case rockyou

``wget https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/raw/master/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt.tar.gz``

Extracting the file with

``tar xf rockyou.txt.tar.gz``

and removing the redundant tar-file after extraction

``rm rockyou.txt.tar.gz``

After this, I used hashcat to figure out the hashing algorithm. 

``hashid -m 6b1628b016dff46e6fa35684be6acc96``

Which returned a list of different algorithms. Based on the top three results MD2, MD5 and MD4, I decided to test out MD5 (Hashcat Mode = 0) first, as suggested by Tero in his guide (much more common than MD2 or MD4).

``hashcat -m 0 '6b1628b016dff46e6fa35684be6acc96' rockyou.txt -o solved``

This is where I ran into an issue. The terminal returned an error **"Device #1: Not enough allocatable device memory for this attack"**. So it seems I have a RAM limitation. I temporarily shut down my VM to increase the RAM from 2 GB to 4 GB to see if this would resolve the issue. After rebooting the VM, I ran the command again and this time it was executed succesfully. Taking a look at the output file "solved" with

``cat solved``

the password was revealed to be

``6b1628b016dff46e6fa35684be6acc96:summer``

...So the password in this case was "summer"!
