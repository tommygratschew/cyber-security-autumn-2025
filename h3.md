# h3 - Cyber lab

Computer specs used to complete the assignments
* CPU: Intel i5-8250U
* GPU: Intel UHD Graphics 620 (Integrated Graphics on CPU)
* RAM: 8 GB

b) Linux. Install Linux on a virtual machine. Use Debian 13-Trixie.

I had previously installed VirtualBox on my desktop computer in the voluntary assignment of h1. For this task I decided to do it again on my laptop, as this is the computer I use for the lectures and is therefore more meaningful to have the VM and Linux installed on this computer instead. I started by downloading Oracle VirtualBox (7.2.4) & Extension pack from the VirtualBox download page. While trying to install VirtuaBox on my computer I ran into a couple of issues. Firstly it seemed I was missing Microsoft Visual C++ redistributable 2019 from the computer which made the VirtualBox installer failed. After downloading and installing the X64 version of the Latest supported (2015–2022) package and rebooting my computer the installer worked. While doing this reboot I also made sure I had Virtualization enabled in my laptops BIOS.

c) Crack. Crack the hash 6b1628b016dff46e6fa35684be6acc96 .
