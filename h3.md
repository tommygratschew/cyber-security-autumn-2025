# h3 - Cyber lab

Computer hardware used to complete the assignments

* CPU: Intel i5-8250U
* GPU: Intel UHD Graphics 620 (Integrated Graphics on CPU)
* RAM: 8 GB

***

b) Linux. Install Linux on a virtual machine. Use Debian 13-Trixie.

I had previously installed VirtualBox on my desktop computer in the voluntary assignment of h1. For this task I decided to do it again on my laptop, as this is the computer I use for the lectures and is therefore more meaningful to have the VM and Linux installed on this computer instead. I started by downloading Oracle VirtualBox (7.2.4) & Extension pack from the VirtualBox download page. While trying to install VirtuaBox on my computer I ran into a couple of issues. Firstly it seemed I was missing Microsoft Visual C++ redistributable 2019 from the computer which made the VirtualBox installer failed. After downloading and installing the X64 version of the Latest supported (2015–2022) package and rebooting my computer the installer worked. While doing this reboot I also made sure I had Virtualization enabled in my laptops BIOS.

To create the VM itself I started by clicking the "New" -button on VirtualBox Manager. I specified the following attributes for the VM (other settings left at default values):

VM Name = Debian
ISO Image = debian-live-13.1.0-amd64-xfce.iso (ISO downloaded in h2 section d.)
Proceed with Unattended Installation = Unchecked
OS Version = Debian 13 Trixie (64-bit)
Base Memory = 2048 MB
Number of CPUs = 2
Disk Size = 40 GB

After this I clicked "Finish" and launched the VM. On the boot menu I chose the default option "Live machine (amd64)". After a bit of waiting I was brought to the Debian Desktop. From here I clicked the Shortcut "Install Debian". For the options I chose the following:

Language = American English
Location = Helsinki
Keyboard = Finnish (Default)
Partitions = Erase disk
User = I defined my name, username and password. Chose a random, non-identifiable name for the computer

After defining these attributes I proceeded to install Debian on the VM.

c) Crack. Crack the hash 6b1628b016dff46e6fa35684be6acc96 .
