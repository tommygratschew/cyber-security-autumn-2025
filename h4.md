# h4 - Feed me

Computer hardware used to complete the assignment:

* CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 5800X
* GPU: AMD RX 6800 16GB
* RAM: 32 GB

***

Before starting the assignment I chose to install VirtualBox 7.2.4 and Debian 13 Trixie on my PC (different computer from the laptop I performed assignments in h3 with) as this would be the computer this assignment will be carried out on. I followed the same steps for installation as described in my h3 assignment report apart from increasing the amount of CPU cores allocated from 2 to 4 and the RAM allocated from 2GB to 4GB.

I also installed VirtualBox Guest additions in order to get things like shared clipboard to work between the VM and my Host PC. To do this, I first mounted the Guest additions ISO-file from Devices -> Insert Guest Additions CD Image

I then opened the ISO by double-clicking it on the desktop. To start the installation I right-clicked within the folder and chose "Open Terminal Here". From the terminal, I initiated the installation process by running the installation script with:

``./autorun.sh``

This prompted me for my password, after which the installation process started and was completed successfully. After installation I restarted the VM and tested the shared clipboard feature. I first needed to enable it from the VirtualBox menus under Devices -> Shared Clipboard -> Bidirectional. After doing this I tested the functionality and confirmed that shared clipboard was indeed working now, which would seem to indicate that our Guest Additions installation was a success!
