# h4 - Feed me

Computer hardware used to complete the assignment:

* CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 5800X
* GPU: AMD RX 6800 16GB
* RAM: 32 GB

***

Before starting the assignment I chose to install VirtualBox 7.2.4 and Debion 13 Trixie on my PC (different computer from the laptop I performed assignments in h3 with) as this would be the computer this assignment will be carried out on. I followed the same steps for installation as described in my h3 assignment report apart from increasing the amount of CPU cores allocated from 2 to 4 and the RAM allocated from 2GB to 4GB.
