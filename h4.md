# h4 - Feed me

Computer hardware used to complete the assignment:

* CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 5800X
* GPU: AMD RX 6800 16GB
* RAM: 32 GB

***

Before starting the assignment I chose to install VirtualBox 7.2.4 and Debian 13 Trixie on my PC (different computer from the laptop I performed assignments in h3 with) as this would be the computer this assignment will be carried out on. I followed the same steps for installation as described in my h3 assignment report apart from increasing the amount of CPU cores allocated from 2 to 4 and the RAM allocated from 2GB to 4GB.

I also installed VirtualBox Guest Additions in order to get things like shared clipboard to work between the VM and my Host PC. To do this, I first mounted the Guest additions ISO-file from Devices -> Insert Guest Additions CD Image

I then opened the ISO by double-clicking it on the desktop. To start the installation I right-clicked within the folder and chose "Open Terminal Here". From the terminal, I initiated the installation process by running the installation script with:

``./autorun.sh``

This prompted me for my password, after which the installation process started and was completed successfully. After installation I restarted the VM and tested the shared clipboard feature. I first needed to enable it from the VirtualBox menus under Devices -> Shared Clipboard -> Bidirectional. After doing this I tested the functionality and confirmed that shared clipboard was indeed working now, which would seem to indicate that our Guest Additions installation was a success!

## x) Why would you want to use a feed reader (and RSS/Atom)? Couldn't you just browse to each website?

Being unfamiliard with feed readers, I would assume from the way Tero has worded the assignment that Feed readers are a great way to combine multiple news sources to a singular feed that is then easier and faster to browse through instead of scrounging multiple different websites, blogs, news outlets etc. 

Wanting to verify this hypothesis I searched and found an article by RSS (2025) on how RSS feeds work. The article confirms what I suspected, the RSS feeds combine and serve articles from sources the user has subscribed to in real-time, making it unnecessary to check the websites for updates / new articles individually. This seems rather promising and I'm suprised how I have managed to avoid this concept altogether for this long!

## y) KKO:2003:36 Summary

- A 17 year old was charged for performing a port-scan against a finnish banks network in 1998
- The legal process seemed to be quite strenuous, advancing from district court to the court of appeals and ultimately into the Finnish Supreme Court through the years 2000-2003
- The defendant was ultimately charged with attempted data breach by the Finnish Supreme Court and sentenced to paying fines to the bank
  - Basically scanning public IP-addresses available through the Internet lead to this charge
  - No mention if the defendant claimed to have accidentally scanned the ports or not... Doesn't probably matter in this context. Need to be extremely careful when performing a scan and verify you are performing it only against permitted targets / yourself.

## a) Install a feed reader

For this assignment I started by searching the web for RSS readers. There seemed to be a lot of In-browser options that operated on subscription models where most useful features were locked behind a subscription to the service. Ultimately I ended up on installing Fluent Reader on my host OS. It seemed like a great choice being Open-Source, privacy oriented and most of all free.

## b, c & d) Add the feed for Krebs, Schneier on Security and two more security related feeds

For this assignment I started by navigating to Krebs' site and locating the RSS feed icon in the top right corner of the page, I copied the link from this icon and added it as a source to Fluent Reader. For Schneier the RSS subscription icon was located on the right side of the site from where I copied it and pasted it as a source as well. For the two additional feeds I decided to go for Darknet Diaries and the Finnish National Cyber Security Centre, I copied the feed links from both and added them as sources.

## e) Follow security feeds for a while. What did you learn?

## f) Port scan
