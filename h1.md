## a) Finding a suitable review article

The first task was to find a relevant review article based or related to the topics that will be discussed in the course. The article had to fulfill a couple of requirements for it to be acceptable. These were: the article had to be a review article, it had to be published in a reputable peer-reviewed academic journal verified with a JUFO-rating of 1 or higher and it should be rather recent, preferably less than two years old.

I decided on looking for an article based on mobile/radio network security as this is a topic that interests me for work and personal reasons. Utilizing Google Scholar, I started searching for an article and eventually with the search term "intitle:review communication network security" found an article that seemed interesting and suitable, the title being "A review of 6G and AI convergence: Enhancing communication networks with artificial intelligence". Glancing through the article, it seemed to take a much broader look into 6G and AI apart from only security aspects, but there were a lot of great points about it as well in the review, so it felt suitable to choose it for this assignment! The addition of an AI viewpoint / angle in the review was a positive, because for better or worse AI seems to be in everything and I wanted to see what sort of points the article made about leveraging AI for security purposes in radio access networks. After verifying that the academic journal the article was published in was reputable enough for this assignment (JUFO score of 1, Journal JUFO ID 88891), everything seemed to be in order.

## b) Review and summarization the article

The second task was to read, review and summarize the article. As the review article I chose included a lot of aspects not directly related to cyber security; the topic of the course, I decided to disregard those sections of the article and focus on the segments related to network security. The assignment gave three questions that the summary should answer in a bullet point format:

### What are the key areas being researched?
### What's widely agreed upon?
### What are the open questions?
