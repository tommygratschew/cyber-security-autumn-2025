## a) Finding a suitable review article

The first task was to find a relevant review article based or related to the topics that will be discussed in the course. The article had to fulfill a couple of requirements for it to be acceptable. These were: the article had to be a review article, it had to be published in a reputable peer-reviewed academic journal verified with a JUFO-rating of 1 or higher and it should be rather recent, preferably less than two years old.

I decided on looking for an article based on mobile/radio network security as this is a topic that interests me for work and personal reasons. Utilizing Google Scholar, I started searching for an article and eventually with the search term "intitle:review communication network security" found an article that seemed interesting and suitable, the title being "A review of 6G and AI convergence: Enhancing communication networks with artificial intelligence". Glancing through the article, it seemed to take a much broader look into 6G and AI apart from only security aspects, but there were a lot of great points about it as well in the review. Crawling through the sources referred to in this article, I found a more security specific article from 2021 titled "AI and 6G security: Opportunities and challenges". Even though the article didn't fulfill the preferred condition of being published in the last few years it was recent enough in my opinion to be relevant for the sake of this assignment. The addition of an AI viewpoint / angle in the review was a positive, because for better or worse AI seems to be in everything now and I wanted to see what sort of points the article made about leveraging AI for security purposes in radio access networks. After verifying that the academic journal the article was published in was reputable enough for this assignment (JUFO score of 1, Journal JUFO ID 5475), everything seemed to be in order.

## b) Review and summarization of the article

The second task was to read, review and summarize the article. The assignment gave three questions that the summary should answer in a bullet point format:

**What are the key areas being researched?**

* The security threat landscape of 6G networks
* The role of AI in 6G network security and privacy
* Possible issues and solutions

**What's widely agreed upon?**

* In the future wireless applications will require increased data rates (up to 1 Tb/s), lower latency (< 1 ms) and higher operational reliability (99.99999%), which 6G will enable

* 6G networks will take shape as an highly automated interconnected mesh network that will consist of a wide area network and smaller sub-networks (such as in-body networks for example)

* In a 6G landscape everything is connected. Internet of Things is transformed into -> Internet of Everything. This opens up a lot of new attack surface for malicous actors.

* 6G Security threat landscape can be divided into three categories: Pre-6G Security Issues (eg. Legacy issues inherited from 5G), Security Threats of 6G Architecture (eg. increased attack surface enabled by mesh networks and IoE devices) and Security Threats of 6G Technologies (eg. AI / ML security and privacy or how quantum computing will affect security as current widely used cryptography methods will become insufficient)

**What are the open questions?**

The article poses a multitude of questions with integrating AI in 6G networks in the form of issues and then also proposes possible solutions to these as well. The questions posed within the article are as follows:

* How to handle AI / ML security issues, such as:
  * Poisoning attacks (data injection, data manipulation or logic corruption)
  * Evasion attacks
  * Model extraction
  * Model inversion
  * Membership inference
* How to handle AI / ML privacy issues, such as:
  * Unintentional user data leaks
  * Data theft
* How to handle AI / ML ethical issues, such as:
  * Machines cannot address ethical considerations in the same way as humans do
  * Ethics based on data used to train the model
  * Unable to behave against logic in exceptional situations
* How to mitigate / defend against the use of AI for attacking 6G networks
  * AI / ML can be used to identify patterns and vulnerabilities in the network and the those vulnerabilites can be used for malicious behaviour

## c) Email alert for interesting articles

To create an email alert for new interesting articles, I navigated to the Google Scholar web page and logged in with my account. After searching for articles (eg. in this example I used the term "intitle:review communication network security") I used the "Create notification" button in the left column to create an email alert for new articles fitting this search term. By default the notification includes only the most fitting results.

## d) Installing Linux on a virtual machine

I have installed Linux on a VM a couple times before, so I wasn't that unfamiliar with the process. Out of old habits I installed Oracle VirtualBox (7.2.4) and for the distro I decided to go with Kali (2025.3). I downloaded the Pre-Made Kali VirtualBox image and extracted it with 7z. After extraction I opened the provided .vbox (VirtualBox Machine Definition) file in the VirtualBox Manager, which created a VM for me with predefined attributes / allocations (2048MB of RAM, 2 CPU cores). At this point I also had to enable CPU Virtualization in BIOS as it seemed I had it turned off and the VM couldn't be booted without it enabled. Starting the VM, I logged in with the default credentials kali/kali and was brought to the desktop.

## Edits & notes

07.12.2025 - During cross-evaluations it was pointed out that the article I chose was indeed a conference paper, not a review article. This is true and a mistake on my part... Due to personal time constraints, I didn't choose a new article to do the assignment again. Need to be more careful with this in the future!
