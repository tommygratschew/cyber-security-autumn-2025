# h1 - CyberScience

a) The first task was to find a relevant review article based or related to the topics that will be discussed in the course. The article had to fulfill a couple of requirements for it to be acceptable. These were: the article had to be a review article, it had to be published in a reputable peer-reviewed academic journal verified with a JUFO-rating of 1 or higher and it should be rather recent, preferably less than two years old.

I decided on looking for an article based on 5G network security as this is a topic that interests me for work and personal reasons. Utilizing Google Scholar, I started searching for an article with the search term "intitle:review 5G network security" I found an article that seemed interesting and suitable, the title being "Balancing sustainability and security: a review of 5G and IoT in smart cities". I verified that the academic journal the article was published in was reputable enough for this assignment and everything seemed to be in order as it had a JUFO score of 1.
