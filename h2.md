## a) Podcast summary - Darknet Diaries EP 103: Cloud Hopper
- Interview with a incident responder, threat analyst and a red teamer Fabio Viggiani who works for a cybersecurity service provider Truesec.
  
- Topic of the interview was about an incident where a client received a notification about potential malicious activity in their network from the Swedish Security Service and contacted Truesec for an investigation.
  - Server in the clients network was contacting a known malicious Command-and-Control (C&C) server
  - During investigation they uncovered that the breach originated from the clients Managed service providers (MSP) network.
  - Compromised server was a jump box that the MSP used for management of the clients network.
  - Initial attackers had used tools such as Mimikatz for password extraction and methods such as DLL side-loading for malicious code injection.
  - There seemed to be multiple teams of attackers based on attack methods and tools used, which indicated that a nation state actor might have been behind the attack.
  - Cleanup of client's infection was difficult due to extensive compromise, legacy systems etc.
  - After cleanup, Active monitoring and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools used to monitor and verify that all malicious activity was discovered and eliminated.
    
- Truesec informed the MSP of possible compromise
  - MSP was compromised and through them a lot of their clients (hundreds to thousands of customers) so basically a supply chain attack.
  - True target of attack seemed to be the U.S. Department of Defence (DoD) and the attacker seemed to be trying to find possible ways in to their network through the MSP and their clients (looking for contractors for DoD with access to their network etc.).
    
- Couple of years after the incindent the U.S. Department of Justice announced criminal indictment of two hackers associated with the Chinese government related to this incident.
  - Hackers seemed to have gained access and stolen intellectual property of private companies and the personal information of over 100,000 Navy personnel.
 
## b) Blog summary - Traficom and Supo: Cyber security threat level remains high – serious cases on the rise
- The following blog article is a press release by Traficom and the Finnish Security and Intelligence Service (Supo) about the current cybersecurity threat landscape in Finland.
  - threat level has increased after Russia launched its attack against Ukraine in 2022.
  - Based on reports to National Cyber Security Centre Finland (NCSC-FI) hostile cyber activity targeting Finnish organisations has increased.
    - Number of serious cases investigated by NCSC-FI more than doubled in comparison to last year
  - Fortunately, the likelihood or risk of society paralysing cyber attacks considered to be low by Traficom and Supo.
 
- In comparison to last year, the speed at which fresh vulnerabilities are being exploited in attacks has increased rapidly.
  - AI not mentioned, but maybe partly the reason?

- Phishing and scam messages on the rise, 64% increase in the past quarter alone.
  - Bank-themed phishing messages especially prevalent.
  - Technological development resulting in new opportunities for bad actors mentioned by NCSC-FI Director General Anssi Kärkkäinen.
    - Probably referring to AI? as it seems to be rather good for translating / creating grammatically correct text etc.
   
- Finland and Finnish organisations well prepared for cyber threats, but need to always stay alert.

- State-sponsored cyber threats remain active
  - Russia's cyber threat against Finland dependent on how the war in Ukraine develops
    - When the war subsides or ends Russia can reallocate cyber capabilities more towards other countries such as Finland
   
  - China's cyber threat against Finland remains active.
   - Finnish network infrastructure and poorly protected consumer devices used to launch cyber attacks / operations against other countries.
     - Botnet or proxy usage? Not specified.

## c) Science that

For this part of the assignment I chose to focus on the supply chain attack described in the Darknet Diaries EP 103: Cloud Hopper, as this seemed an interesting topic to tie some theory to. In the podcast it was mentioned that the malicious attacker that gained access to Truesec's client's network was able to do so through gaining possession of login credentials of one of the employees of the managed service provider and then using those credentials to log into the client's server. In the literature review by Ghadge, Weiß, Caldwell, & Wilding this sort of key failure point is described as a Point of Penetration (PoP). In the review PoPs are categorized into three distinct categories: 

- Technological PoPs
  - Systems
  - Software
  - Personnel
  - Equipment
- Human PoPs
  - Insider threat
  - Accidental exposure
  - Forced collaboration (Blackmail, viruses etc.)
- Physical PoPs
  - Buildings
  - Machines
  - Other surroundings
 
In this case the PoP was technical as the client had outsourced IT management to a MSP from which the attacker gained access to the client's systems / network.

A similar recent security event that comes to mind where this sort of failure point was witnessed happened to the popular social platform Discord earlier this year. In this case Discord's customer data got leaked through a third party customer service portal that a malicious actor was able to gain credentials for. The attacker was able to extract customer data like names, addresses, emails, partial payment information etc. from support tickets. What made this attack even more severe in my opinion was that a lot of identifiable information about minors was leaked (mainly due to UK's Online Safety Act and similar laws in some other countries... go figure), which could be used for nefarious activity in the future.

## d) Downloading Debian

As per instructions given in the assignment, I downloaded the Debian 13.1.0 Live Xfce.
