## a) Darknet Diaries EP 103 summary
- Interview with a incident responder, threat analyst and a red teamer Fabio Viggiani who works for a cybersecurity service provider Truesec.
- Topic of the interview was about an incident where a client received a notification about potential malicious activity in their network from the Swedish Security Service and contacted Truesec for an investigation.
  - Server in the clients network was contacting a known malicious Command-and-Control (C&C) server
  - During investigation they uncovered that the breach originated from the clients Managed service providers (MSP) network.
  - Compromised server was a jump box that the MSP used for management of the clients network.
  - Initial attackers had used tools such as Mimikatz for password extraction and methods such as DLL side-loading for malicious code injection.
  - There seemed to be multiple teams of attackers based on attack methods and tools used which indicated that a nation state actor was behind the attack
  - Cleanup of client's infection was difficult due to extensive compromise, legacy systems etc.
  - Active monitoring and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools used to monitor and verify that all malicious activity was discovered and eliminated.
- Truesec informed the MSP of possible compromise
  - MSP was compromised and through them a lot of their clients (hundreds to thousands of customers) so basically a supply chain attack
  - True target of attack seemed to be the U.S. Department of Defence (DoD) and the attacker seemed to try to find possible ways in to their network through the MSP and their clients (looking for contractors for DoD with access to their network etc.)
- Couple of years after the incindent the U.S. Department of Justice announced criminal indictment of two hackers associated with the Chinese government related to this incident.
  - Hackers seemed to have gained access and stolen intellectual property of private companies and the personal information of over 100 000 Navy personnel.
