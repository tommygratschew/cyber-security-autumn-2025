## a) Podcast summary - Darknet Diaries EP 103: Cloud Hopper
- Interview with a incident responder, threat analyst and a red teamer Fabio Viggiani who works for a cybersecurity service provider Truesec.
  
- Topic of the interview was about an incident where a client received a notification about potential malicious activity in their network from the Swedish Security Service and contacted Truesec for an investigation.
  - Server in the clients network was contacting a known malicious Command-and-Control (C&C) server
  - During investigation they uncovered that the breach originated from the clients Managed service providers (MSP) network.
  - Compromised server was a jump box that the MSP used for management of the clients network.
  - Initial attackers had used tools such as Mimikatz for password extraction and methods such as DLL side-loading for malicious code injection.
  - There seemed to be multiple teams of attackers based on attack methods and tools used, which indicated that a nation state actor might have been behind the attack.
  - Cleanup of client's infection was difficult due to extensive compromise, legacy systems etc.
  - After cleanup, Active monitoring and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools used to monitor and verify that all malicious activity was discovered and eliminated.
    
- Truesec informed the MSP of possible compromise
  - MSP was compromised and through them a lot of their clients (hundreds to thousands of customers) so basically a supply chain attack.
  - True target of attack seemed to be the U.S. Department of Defence (DoD) and the attacker seemed to be trying to find possible ways in to their network through the MSP and their clients (looking for contractors for DoD with access to their network etc.).
    
- Couple of years after the incindent the U.S. Department of Justice announced criminal indictment of two hackers associated with the Chinese government related to this incident.
  - Hackers seemed to have gained access and stolen intellectual property of private companies and the personal information of over 100,000 Navy personnel.
 
## b) Blog summary - Traficom and Supo: Cyber security threat level remains high – serious cases on the rise
- The following blog article is a press release by Traficom and the Finnish Security and Intelligence Service (Supo) about the current cybersecurity threat landscape in Finland.
  - threat level has increased after Russia launched its attack against Ukraine in 2022.
  - Based on reports to National Cyber Security Centre Finland (NCSC-FI) hostile cyber activity targeting Finnish organisations has increased.
    - Number of serious cases investigated by NCSC-FI more than doubled in comparison to last year
  - Fortunately, the likelihood or risk of society paralysing cyber attacks considered to be low by Traficom and Supo.
 
- In comparison to last year, the speed at which fresh vulnerabilities are being exploited in attacks has increased rapidly.
  - AI not mentioned, but maybe partly the reason?

- Phishing and scam messages on the rise, 64% increase in the past quarter alone.
  - Bank-themed phishing messages especially prevalent.
  - Technological development resulting in new opportunities for bad actors mentioned by NCSC-FI Director General Anssi Kärkkäinen.
    - Probably referring to AI? as it seems to be rather good for translating / creating grammatically correct text etc.
   
- Finland and Finnish organisations well prepared for cyber threats, but need to always stay alert.

- State-sponsored cyber threats remain active
  - Russia's cyber threat against Finland dependent on how the war in Ukraine develops
    - When the war subsides or ends Russia can reallocate cyber capabilities more towards other countries such as Finland
   
  - China's cyber threat against Finland remains active.
   - Finnish network infrastructure and poorly protected consumer devices used to launch cyber attacks / operations against other countries.
     - Botnet or proxy usage? Not specified.
