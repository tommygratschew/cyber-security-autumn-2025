# h7 - SecuDream

## a) SecuDream(tm). Cyber security course ... of my dreams.

### Goals for the course

1. Able to outline key cybersecurity practices, concepts, frameworks etc. and identify how they are implemented in the students own organization / how they could be improved.

2. Able to outline valid and up-to-date sources for cybersecurity knowledge, news etc. and how to identify good sources from bad ones

3. Hands on experiences on basic tools and methods related to cybersecurity (e.g. virtualization, password cracking,  port scanning etc.)

4. Get the student personally invested and interested in Cyber Security (e.g. has to have some sort of motivation to pick the course -> cultivate and inspire that motivation)

### Agenda

#### Week 1 - Basic cybersecurity concepts

  - Basic concepts
  - Threat modeling

#### Week 2 - Cybersecurity Scene

  - What does the scene look like?
  - Where to follow?
     - News
     - Feeds
     - Podcasts
     - Forums?
  - More scientific sources?  

#### Week 3 - Cybersecurity frameworks

  - Cybermeter (I think this was a great example in the context of the course)
  - C2M2, NIST
  - More extensive frameworks like ISO-27001?

#### Week 4 - Linux and virtualization introduction

  - Virtualization (VirtualBox etc.)
  - Installing linux, command line basics etc.
  - Basic get-to-know exercise

#### Week 5 - Cryptography

  - Hashes, Public key cryptography etc.

#### Week 6 - Cryptography 2 Electric Boogaloo (Continuing from previous week)

#### Week 7 - Network security

  - Basic networking concepts (IP-addresses, network appliances etc. how they form a communication network)
  - Firewalls

#### Week 8 - Application security

  - API:s
  - Supply chain attacks etc.

### Exercises

#### Week 1 - Threat modeling

- Some sort of threat modeling related exercise based on the students own or imagined organization / predetermined example

#### Week 2 - Explore that scene

- Getting to know the cybersecurity scene, h2 from the course as-is. Personally really enjoyed that exercise!

#### Week 3 - Frameworks

- Cybersecurity framework exercise, h6 from the course as-is. I feel like this gave a very nice and relevant look at cybersecurity frameworks.

#### Week 4 - Linux and virtualization

- Installing linux on a virtual machine
- Command line basics

#### Week 5 - Cryptography

- How passwords are hacked
- Finding information about possible data leaks
- Hands-on lab with a password cracking exercise

#### Week 6 - Cryptography

- More technical and scientific look at cryptography. h5 as-is? Was an exellent exercise about this!

#### Week 7 - How do networks function? 

- Nmap exercise (the OP port scan incident was a great example!)
- UFW or some other firewall based exercise.
  - Could be like renting a virtual server from a service provider, securing it with public key authentication, fail2ban, firewall rules etc. and setting up a basic static website on it.

#### Week 8 - Apps

- Something hands on related to API:s or other application related aspects? I was facinated by these based on other student presentations and would have hoped we had some sort of "real-life" example on how these sort of vulnerabilities are exploited and how they can be secured.

#### Presentation

- I would make the presentations group-based to cut down on the amount of presentations while hopefully increasing the quality and breadth of them.
- Could be assigned based on each weeks agenda or chosen freely.
- Would also leave more time to go through subjects or homework during each session!

### Frameworks 

- Cybermeter was an excellent choice for this as it's brief enough to understand quickly, but gives a great view on important topics about cybersecurity maturity and is very relevant to finnish organizations as it's maintained by Traficom.
- ISO-27001 is probably the most familiar name-wise so maybe something related to that as well... Though is probably too extensive for learning purposes. 

### Visiting lecturers, excursions, events

- Visit to a cybersecurity event would be amazing! (Cyber Security Nordic, HelSec etc.)

### Rationale
